        <h1>Portofolio, you say?</h1>
        <p>Hi! Yes, this is my web portofolio in which I share my creations, passions and interests. As I take on more projects, I will update and improve the design of the website. My end goal is to be able to say that this site is my reflection, but until then, there's enough time!</p>

    <div class="abouttext">
        <h1>But, who are you?</h1>
        <p>I study Multimedia Design in Denmark, at KEA, Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. I try to spread happiness wherever I can because I think the world needs a little bit more of that. I am passionate about photography, graphic design, programming and many others.</p>
